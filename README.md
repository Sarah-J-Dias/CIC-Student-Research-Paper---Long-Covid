# CIC-Student-Research-Paper---Long-Covid
This repository contains the R-code which I used to analyze data from the U.S. Census Bureauâ€™s Household Pulse Survey (HPS Phase 4.2 Cycle 9), specifically Health Tables 5 (vaccination) and 8 (Long COVID).  My analysis investigated vaccination disparities, vaccination vs. Long COVID prevalence, and severity of long Covid by demographic.
